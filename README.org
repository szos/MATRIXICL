* Purpose 
  There are two main purposes
  1. to learn the clim protocol
  2. to create a GUI for :matrix-query
* Usage
  Currently this project is mostly worthless, as it doesnt implement any actual functionality. one can enter the app with
  #+begin common-lisp
  ``
  (matrix-clim-client:app-main)
  ``
  #+end
